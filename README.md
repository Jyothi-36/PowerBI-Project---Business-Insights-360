## Importing data into PowerBI

- As the database is **MySQL** in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBI by providing the Database access credential.

## Data Model

- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the overall performance of the report.
- Following good practices of data modeling is must. Refer this page to get to know the good practices [Blog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
- In this project, we have followed Star Schema data modeling method.
